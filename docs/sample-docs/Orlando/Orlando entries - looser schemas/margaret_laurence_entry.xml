The bone healed within ten days. Jocelyn lived through a greater danger at two months, when her smallpox and yellow fever injections, for Africa, were administered too close together and in the wrong order. The baby went into convulsions, while the doctor concerned (who was angry with Laurence for insisting on continuing to breast-feed while her daughter was severely ill in hospital) ascribed the convulsions to either a congenital tendency or else meningitis. Two years later another doctor admitted that the first had been at fault. When Laurence got pregnant in <PLACE><GEOG>Ghana</GEOG></PLACE> a pregnancy test falsely registered negative, netting her a diagnosis of <SOCALLED>neurotic</SOCALLED>, and after that she had two false labours before managing a swift natural childbirth, assisted by a reassuring black midwife.
