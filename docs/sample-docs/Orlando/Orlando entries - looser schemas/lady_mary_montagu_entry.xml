After her initial, dangerous and prolonged fever in 1746 (which was probably malaria), she suffered a number of recurrences. She also went down with severe periodontal or gum disease. The ulcers in her mouth were so bad that a surgeon, hastily summoned, cauterized her gums with hot irons. He was none too sure that she would survive; but she did.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Grundy 480ff, 497, 498, 505-6" DBREF="172">480ff, 497, 498, 505-6</BIBCIT></BIBCITS> Before she finally left Italy she must have known that she had breast cancer.</P></SHORTPROSE></DIV2></HEALTH></DIV1><DIV1><LOCATION RELATIONTO="MOVED"><DIV2><HEADING>A Getaway</HEADING><CHRONSTRUCT RELEVANCE="SELECTIVE" CHRONCOLUMN="BRITISHWOMENWRITERS" RESP="IMG"><DATE>August 1756</DATE><CHRONPROSE>After several years of thwarted attempts to leave <PLACE><REGION>Brescia</REGION><GEOG REG="Italy"></GEOG></PLACE> for <PLACE><SETTLEMENT>Venice</SETTLEMENT><GEOG REG="Italy"></GEOG></PLACE>, LMWM succeeded, in the face of actual physical threat from <NAME STANDARD="Palazzi, Ugolino">Palazzi</NAME>, in getting away.</CHRONPROSE><BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Montagu, Romance Writings 100-5" DBREF="543">100-5</BIBCIT></BIBCITS></CHRONSTRUCT></DIV2></LOCATION></DIV1><DIV1><VIOLENCE><DIV2><SHORTPROSE><P><NAME STANDARD="Palazzi, Ugolino">Palazzi</NAME> had accompanied her from Lovere to Gottolengo a couple of months earlier, and effectively prevented her from going further.

She was urged, under implicit threat of violence, to sign a disclaimer exonerating Palazzi from any wrong-doing. At her absolute refusal to sign, Palazzi backed down, perhaps owing to the influence of his aunt, who seems to have sided with Lady Mary against her nephew.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Montagu, Romance Writings 100-5" DBREF="543">100-5</BIBCIT></BIBCITS></P></SHORTPROSE></DIV2></VIOLENCE></DIV1><DIV1><HEADING>Venice and Padua</HEADING><LOCATION RELATIONTO="LIVED"><DIV2><CHRONSTRUCT RELEVANCE="SELECTIVE" CHRONCOLUMN="BRITISHWOMENWRITERS" RESP="IMG"><DATERANGE CERTAINTY="C" FROM="1756-09-05" TO="1761-09-" EXACT="BOTH">September 1756-September 1761</DATERANGE><CHRONPROSE>LMWM lived at <PLACE><SETTLEMENT>Venice</SETTLEMENT><GEOG REG="Italy"></GEOG></PLACE> and <PLACE><SETTLEMENT>Padua</SETTLEMENT><GEOG REG="Italy"></GEOG></PLACE>, at each of which she bought a house.</CHRONPROSE><BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Montagu, Complete 3:111-278" DBREF="106862">3: 111-278</BIBCIT></BIBCITS></CHRONSTRUCT></DIV2></LOCATION></DIV1><DIV1><FRIENDSASSOCIATES><DIV2><SHORTPROSE><P>This move enabled her to pick up the threads with old friends, including <NAME STANDARD="Michiel, Chiara">Chiara Michiel</NAME> and <NAME STANDARD="Algarotti, Francesco">Algarotti</NAME>, and to find new intimates in the Jacobite exiles <NAME STANDARD="Steuart, Sir James">Sir James</NAME> and <NAME>Lady Frances Steuart</NAME>.
