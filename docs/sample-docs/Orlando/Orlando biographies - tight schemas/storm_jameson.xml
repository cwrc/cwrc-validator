                        <P>Brittain&apos;s stay was strained by the tense relations between her and
                            Jameson&apos;s family, with Jameson often caught in the middle of their
                            arguments. Brittain sent Jameson a letter of gratitude for her efforts
                            in <DATE VALUE="1940-12-">December</DATE> of that year. After that,
                            however, their friendship was threatened by other pressures. First they
                            quarrelled over Jameson&apos;s characterizations in <TITLE
                                TITLETYPE="ANALYTIC">The Hour of Prague</TITLE>, and then the
                            writing and publication of her pamphlet <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC"
                                >The End of This War</TITLE>, <DATE>1941</DATE>, prompted an
                            increasingly hostile series of letters between them. Jameson had only
                            recently begun to disclose to Brittain her sharp turn away from
                            pacifism, and in her pamphlet she used an excerpt of one of
                            Brittain&apos;s letters to illustrate the weaknesses of the pacifist
                            position. Brittain removed Jameson from her will and, on discovering
                            this, Jameson effectively ended their relationship: though she had
                            refused any financial legacy, she had warmly accepted her appointment as
                            Brittain&apos;s literary executor and guardian of her children. Brittain

                        <P>SJ filled her life with family concerns, activism, travel, and
                            friendships with diverse women and men. Her extensive literary output,
                            sometimes inspired by her own rich experience, frequently examines
                            women&apos;s changing domestic and public roles. Though she felt some of
                            the consequences of limitations placed upon women in her historical
                            moment, she was not stopped by them: instead, she often assumed her
                            linked personal, social, and creative commitments in a position of
                            leadership. Late in life, however, she denied any formal identification

                            wealth. She spent some of her early years in poverty and, once
                            published, continued with her creative writing while she took on a
                            variety of commercial assignments in order to support herself and her
                            family. She preferred to spend any income she had on herself and loved
                            ones or to give it to those in greater need, rather than build up any
                            savings. One of her longtime friends, author and former suffragist
