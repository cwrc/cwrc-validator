                                    QV disregarded Albert&apos;s wishes by shortening their stay at

                            the crown could have for an author&apos;s socio-economic position and
                            prestige, also felt that his power to create representations which would

                            than those powers held by the Queen. In a letter to <NAME>Basil

                        <P>Indeed, Dickens constructed the figure of QV as the converse of his own.
                            Referred to as a <SOCALLED>feminine</SOCALLED> writer by literary
                            critics, he sought to assert his masculinity and virility by
                            representing the Queen as domestic and feminine, downplaying her
                            influence and heightening his own. His anxiety about the role of the
                            male writer compared to that of the female monarch was evident in many
                            of his letters and actions. He masked his ambivalence with aloofness,
                            repeatedly declining the Queen&apos;s invitations to meet with or to
                            perform for her. Finally, after twenty-two years of requests, Dickens
                            consented to meet with QV. At this audience he ranted about class
                            issues, though he accepted the Queen&apos;s gift of her book <TITLE

                                grief as appropriate for a widow but not for a leader, complained
                                that her withdrawal was proof that a woman was unsuitable as a monarch.<BIBCITS>
