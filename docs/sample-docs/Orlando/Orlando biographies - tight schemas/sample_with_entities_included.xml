                        <P>From an early age, EG developed a stubborn belief in a particular kind of
                            romantic love. This, she believed, was the only kind of love worth
                            marrying for; it was the love which, according to her mother, her
                            parents had and her mother and stepfather did not. When in her late
                            teenage years Elinor began to receive marriage proposals, including one
                            from a duke and one from a millionaire, she turned them down because she
                            was not romantically in love with these men. To her commitment to
                            romance she added a realistic sense of the necessity of money: <QUOTE
