                            associates thought this distress went beyond the temporary into
                            deep-seated causes, as had been revealed by the physique of army
                            recruits for the Boer War. The meeting, however, explicitly confined
                            itself to the temporary. When discussion moved to the thriftlessness and
                            intemperance of the poor, MG got to her feet with an impassioned speech
                            based on her own experience. Nevertheless, when the committee was
                            struck, she was at first the only labourite on it, the only person not a
                            well-known, leading citizen. In five months 323,414 dinners were
                            provided (only at recognised centres, so children who could not go to
                            school because they had no boots got no dinner). The food was often a
                            lentil roast, guaranteed not to cost more than about a halfpenny a

                    <SHORTPROSE>
                        <P>MG&apos;s friendship with <NAME>Dora Marsden</NAME> ended in a breach.
                            With <NAME>Sylvia Pankhurst</NAME>, too, her relationship later came to
                            grief, but this was after a particularly close period following the
                            birth of Sylvia&apos;s son on <DATE>3 December 1927</DATE>. This was a
                            difficult time for Sylvia, who was hounded by the press, disapproved of
                            by her mother and sister, and seriously short of money. MG recognised
                            Sylvia&apos;s right to be a mother without being a wife, and sent a baby
                            gift; just over a year later the two women entered into regular
                                    correspondence.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Cowman 451-3"

                            publicize Pankhurst&apos;s <TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC">The
                                Suffragette Movement</TITLE> (<DATE VALUE="1931-02-20"
                                CERTAINTY="BY">1931</DATE>) in the USA, even though she was upset by
                            its footnote summarizing her own later suffrage activity in America,
                            which she found totally inadequate and even potentially damaging to her
                            US citizenship. Having enlisted support from a list of distiguished
                            names to market the book in America, she later appealed to some of the
                            same people to compel Pankhurst to issue a revised edition. They
                            exchanged letters about this issue from 1931; in 1934 Gawthorpe&apos;s
                            letters became angry; in 1935 she contacted a lawyer, and silence fell
                            between these former friends.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT
